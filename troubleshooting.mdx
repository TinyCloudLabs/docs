This guide covers the most common issues developers encounter when working with the TinyCloud SDK and how to resolve them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delegation failed: invalid delegatee">
    **Symptom**: Creating a delegation fails with the error "Delegation failed: invalid delegatee" or similar validation error.

    **Cause**: You are using the session DID (`.did`) instead of the PKH DID (`.pkhDid`) when specifying the delegatee.

    **Solution**: Always use `.pkhDid` for user-to-user delegations:

    ```typescript
    // Wrong
    await alice.createDelegation({ delegateDID: bob.did });

    // Correct
    await alice.createDelegation({ delegateDID: bob.pkhDid });
    ```

    See [DID Formats](/concepts/did-formats) for a detailed explanation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Namespace does not exist">
    **Symptom**: Operations fail with "namespace does not exist" or "namespace not found" errors.

    **Cause**: The namespace has not been created, or `autoCreateNamespace` is not enabled.

    **Solution**: Either enable auto-creation or explicitly create the namespace:

    ```typescript
    // Option 1: Enable auto-creation in session config
    const session = await client.createSession({
      autoCreateNamespace: true
    });

    // Option 2: Explicitly ensure the namespace exists
    await session.ensureNamespaceExists();
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session expired">
    **Symptom**: Operations that previously worked now fail with authentication or session errors.

    **Cause**: The session TTL has been exceeded. TinyCloud sessions have a limited lifetime for security.

    **Solution**: Re-authenticate to obtain a new session:

    ```typescript
    // Check if session is still valid
    if (session.isExpired()) {
      // Re-authenticate
      const newSession = await client.createSession();
    }
    ```

    Consider implementing session refresh logic in your application to handle this gracefully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WASM module not found">
    **Symptom**: Import errors or runtime errors about missing WASM modules when using the SDK.

    **Cause**: The WASM package (`@tinycloudlabs/sdk-rs`) was not built before the TypeScript wrappers.

    **Solution**: Rebuild in the correct order:

    ```bash
    # In the web-sdk repository

    # 1. Build WASM first
    cd packages/sdk-rs
    bun run build

    # 2. Then build the wrappers
    cd ../..
    bun run build
    ```

    The build order must be:
    1. `@tinycloudlabs/sdk-rs` (WASM artifacts)
    2. `@tinycloudlabs/node-sdk-wasm` / `@tinycloudlabs/web-sdk-wasm` (TypeScript wrappers)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid private key">
    **Symptom**: Session creation fails with "invalid private key" or key parsing errors.

    **Cause**: The private key is not in the expected format. It must be exactly 32 bytes (64 hexadecimal characters).

    **Solution**: Ensure the key is properly formatted:

    ```typescript
    // Both formats are valid
    const key1 = "0x1234..."; // 64 hex chars after 0x (66 total)
    const key2 = "1234...";   // 64 hex chars without prefix

    // Invalid examples
    const bad1 = "0x123";     // Too short
    const bad2 = "123abc";    // Not 64 characters
    ```

    If generating a key programmatically, ensure you are using a cryptographically secure random source and outputting exactly 32 bytes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sub-delegation rejected: path not within parent">
    **Symptom**: Creating a sub-delegation fails with a path constraint error.

    **Cause**: The path specified in the child delegation is not within the parent's path scope.

    **Solution**: Ensure the child path is a sub-path of the parent:

    ```typescript
    // If parent has path: /users/alice/

    // Valid child paths
    "/users/alice/"         // Same path
    "/users/alice/docs/"    // Sub-path
    "/users/alice/docs/readme.txt"

    // Invalid child paths
    "/users/bob/"           // Different user
    "/users/"               // Parent of the allowed path
    "/admin/"               // Unrelated path
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sub-delegation rejected: expiry exceeds parent">
    **Symptom**: Creating a sub-delegation fails with an expiry constraint error.

    **Cause**: The child delegation's expiry time is later than the parent's expiry.

    **Solution**: Set the child expiry to be equal to or earlier than the parent:

    ```typescript
    // If parent expires at timestamp 1704067200 (Jan 1, 2024)

    // Get parent expiry
    const parentExpiry = parentCapability.expiry;

    // Create child with same or earlier expiry
    await alice.createDelegation({
      delegateDID: bob.pkhDid,
      expiry: parentExpiry, // Same as parent
      // Or: expiry: parentExpiry - 3600 // 1 hour earlier
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign request timed out">
    **Symptom**: Using the event-emitter signing strategy results in timeout errors.

    **Cause**: The sign request was emitted but no handler responded with a signature.

    **Solution**: Ensure you have a listener that handles sign requests:

    ```typescript
    client.on('signRequest', async (request) => {
      // Present signing UI to user
      const signature = await wallet.signMessage(request.message);

      // IMPORTANT: Must call respond()
      request.respond(signature);
    });
    ```

    Common mistakes:
    - Forgetting to call `request.respond()`
    - Not awaiting the signature before responding
    - Listener not registered before session creation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Old session invalid after update">
    **Symptom**: Persisted sessions that worked before a TinyCloud update now fail to load or authenticate.

    **Cause**: The terminology migration from "orbit" to "namespace" (December 2025) invalidated sessions stored with the old `orbitId` field.

    **Solution**: Clear persisted sessions and re-authenticate:

    ```typescript
    // Clear stored session data
    localStorage.removeItem('tinycloud_session');
    // Or for your specific storage mechanism
    await sessionStorage.clear();

    // Re-authenticate to get a new session
    const session = await client.createSession();
    ```

    This is a one-time migration. New sessions use the `namespaceId` field and will persist correctly.

## Still Having Issues?

If your issue is not covered here:

1. Check the [Capabilities](/concepts/capabilities) and [DID Formats](/concepts/did-formats) concept pages for detailed explanations
2. Verify your SDK version is up to date
3. Review the server logs for more detailed error messages
4. Ensure your wallet is connected to the expected network
