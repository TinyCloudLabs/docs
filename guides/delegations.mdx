Delegations allow you to grant other users or services scoped, time-limited access to data in your space. They are the core mechanism for sharing in TinyCloud.

## What Delegations Enable

- **Share data**: Let other users read or write to specific paths in your space
- **Grant permissions**: Allow services to perform operations on your behalf
- **Chain access**: Recipients can create sub-delegations to extend access to others
- **Time-bound access**: Delegations automatically expire -- no manual cleanup required

## Creating a Delegation

Grant another user access to paths in your space by specifying their DID, the actions they can perform, and the paths they can access.

<Warning>
**Critical**: Always use the PKH DID (returned by `tc.did` after sign-in, or `tc.pkhDid`) for the `delegateDID` parameter. Using a session key DID will fail server validation. See [DID Formats](/concepts/did-formats) for details.

```typescript Web SDK
// Alice delegates read access to Bob
const delegation = await tc.storage.delegate({
  delegateDID: bobPkhDid,
  actions: ['read'],
  paths: ['documents/*'],
  expiresIn: '7d',
});

// Send the portable delegation to Bob

  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get', 'tinycloud.kv/put'],

  expiresIn: '7d',

  // Earliest time the delegation becomes valid (optional)

});
```

## Using a Received Delegation

When you receive a delegation (as a portable JSON string), load it into your SDK to access the delegator's space.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Web SDK
// Bob received a portable delegation from Alice
const portableDelegation = /* received from Alice */;

// Load the delegation
await tc.storage.useDelegation(portableDelegation);

// Now Bob can access Alice's space
const docs = await tc.storage.list('documents/', {
  space: aliceSpaceId,
});

const report = await tc.storage.get('documents/report.json', {
  space: aliceSpaceId,
});
```

```typescript Node SDK
// Bob received a portable delegation from Alice
const portableDelegation = /* received from Alice */;

// Load the delegation and get a DelegatedAccess handle
const access = await bob.useDelegation(portableDelegation);

// Use the access handle to read from Alice's space
const data = await access.kv.get('shared/data');
const keys = await access.kv.list('shared/');
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The recipient does not get a copy of the data. They access it directly in the delegator's space, subject to the scoped permissions in the delegation.
</Note>

## DelegatedAccess

When using a delegation in the Node SDK, `useDelegation` returns a `DelegatedAccess` object. This object provides a scoped KV interface that automatically targets the delegator's space.

```typescript
const access = await bob.useDelegation(portableDelegation);

// access.kv is scoped to Alice's space with the delegated permissions
await access.kv.get('shared/document');   // Read from Alice's space
await access.kv.put('shared/response', { message: 'Thanks!' }); // Write to Alice's space
await access.kv.list('shared/');          // List keys in Alice's space
```

## Sub-Delegations

Recipients can further delegate their access to others. Sub-delegations must be strictly narrower than the parent delegation.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Web SDK
// Bob creates a sub-delegation for Carol
const subDelegation = await tc.storage.delegate({
  delegateDID: carolPkhDid,
  actions: ['read'],             // Must be subset of Bob's actions
  paths: ['documents/public/*'], // Must be within Bob's paths
  expiresIn: '1d',               // Must expire before Bob's delegation
});
```

```typescript Node SDK
// Bob sub-delegates to Carol
const subDelegation = await bob.createSubDelegation({
  // The delegation Bob received from Alice
  parentDelegation: aliceDelegation,

  // Carol's PKH DID
  delegateDID: carol.pkhDid,

  // Subset of actions Bob has
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],

  // Narrower path scope
  path: 'documents/public/',

  // Earlier expiry
  expiresIn: '1d',
});

// Send to Carol
sendToUser(carol.address, subDelegation.portable);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Delegation Constraints

Every sub-delegation must be a strict subset of its parent. The server enforces these rules:

| Constraint | Rule | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Actions** | Must be a subset of parent's actions | Parent has `get + put`, child can have `get` only |
| **Paths** | Must be within parent's path scope | Parent has `data/*`, child can have `data/public/*` |
| **Expiry** | Must expire at or before parent's expiry | Parent expires in 7d, child must expire in 7d or less |
| **Not Before** | Must be at or after parent's not_before | Parent starts Jan 1, child cannot start before Jan 1 |

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Valid sub-delegation example">
```typescript
// Parent: read + write to 'data/*', expires in 7 days

await bob.createSubDelegation({
  parentDelegation,
  delegateDID: carol.pkhDid,
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],  // Subset of [get, put]
  path: 'data/public/',           // Within data/*
  expiresIn: '3d',                // Before 7 days
});
// Accepted by server
```

  path: 'other/',                                      // Outside parent scope
  expiresIn: '30d',                                    // After parent expires
});
// Rejected by server
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## DID Format

<Warning>
This is the most common source of delegation failures. Use the PKH DID for delegations, not the session key DID.
</Warning>

TinyCloud uses two DID formats:

| Format | Property | Example | When to Use |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **PKH DID** | `tc.pkhDid` | `did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1234...` | Delegations, user identity |
| **Session Key DID** | `tc.did` | `did:key:z6Mk...#z6Mk...` | Internal session operations |

After sign-in, `tc.did` returns the PKH DID in the Node SDK. The PKH DID represents the user's persistent wallet identity, while the session key DID is ephemeral and rotates on every authentication.

```typescript
// Correct: use pkhDid for delegations
await alice.createDelegation({
  delegateDID: bob.pkhDid,  // did:pkh:eip155:1:0x...
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],
});

// Wrong: session key DID -- will fail server validation
await alice.createDelegation({
  delegateDID: bob.did,     // did:key:z6Mk... -- INCORRECT for delegations
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],
});
```

## PortableDelegation Format

Delegations are serialized as `PortableDelegation` for transport between users. This is a JSON string containing the signed delegation chain, which can be verified cryptographically.

```typescript
// Create and serialize
const delegation = await alice.createDelegation({
  delegateDID: bob.pkhDid,
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],
  path: 'shared/',
});

// The portable format is a JSON string
const portable = delegation.portable;

// Send via any channel: HTTP API, email, QR code, messaging, etc.
sendToRecipient(portable);

// Recipient loads it
const access = await bob.useDelegation(portable);
```

<Tip>
The portable delegation is self-contained. The recipient does not need any additional context to verify and use it -- the cryptographic chain of trust is embedded in the payload.
</Tip>

## Sharing Links

For simpler sharing scenarios, TinyCloud provides a sharing links API that generates a URL containing an embedded delegation. The recipient can access the shared data without being authenticated.

```typescript
// Generate a share link for a specific key
const link = await tc.sharing.generate({
  key: 'profile',
  expiresIn: '7d',
});

console.log(link);
// https://node.tinycloud.xyz/share/eyJhbGciOi...

// Recipient opens the link -- no auth needed
// This is a static method that works without an active session
const result = await TinyCloudWeb.receiveShare(link);
console.log(result);
// { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }
```

<Note>
Sharing links are ideal for one-off sharing with people who may not have a TinyCloud account. For ongoing collaboration, use standard delegations instead.
</Note>

## Revoking Delegations

Currently, delegations expire automatically based on their `expiresIn` value. For scenarios where you need immediate revocation, use short-lived delegations and refresh them as needed.

```typescript
// Short-lived delegation that must be refreshed
const delegation = await alice.createDelegation({
  delegateDID: bob.pkhDid,
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],
  path: 'shared/',
  expiresIn: '1h', // Expires in 1 hour
});

// To "revoke", simply stop issuing new delegations
// The existing one becomes invalid after 1 hour
```

## Complete Example

Alice shares a document folder with Bob, who then shares a subset with Carol.

<Steps>
<Step title="Alice creates a delegation for Bob">
```typescript
// Alice's client
const aliceToBob = await alice.createDelegation({
  delegateDID: bob.pkhDid,
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get', 'tinycloud.kv/put'],
  path: 'documents/',
  expiresIn: '30d',
});

// Send the portable delegation to Bob
sendToUser(bob.address, aliceToBob.portable);
```
</Step>

<Step title="Bob receives and uses the delegation">
```typescript
// Bob's client
const access = await bob.useDelegation(aliceToBobPortable);

// Bob can now read and write to Alice's documents
const files = await access.kv.list('documents/');
const report = await access.kv.get('documents/report.json');

// Bob can also write (he has kv/put)
await access.kv.put('documents/feedback.json', {
  reviewer: 'Bob',
  comments: 'Looks good!',
});
```
</Step>

<Step title="Bob creates a sub-delegation for Carol">
```typescript
// Bob sub-delegates read-only access to a narrower path
const bobToCarol = await bob.createSubDelegation({
  parentDelegation: aliceToBobPortable,
  delegateDID: carol.pkhDid,
  actions: ['tinycloud.kv/get'],       // Read only (subset of Bob's get+put)
  path: 'documents/public/',           // Narrower scope
  expiresIn: '7d',                     // Shorter than Bob's 30 days
});

sendToUser(carol.address, bobToCarol.portable);
```
</Step>

<Step title="Carol accesses the shared data">
```typescript
// Carol's client
const carolAccess = await carol.useDelegation(bobToCarolPortable);

// Carol can read Alice's public documents
const doc = await carolAccess.kv.get('documents/public/readme.txt');

// Carol cannot write (only has kv/get)
// Carol cannot access documents outside documents/public/
```
</Step>
</Steps>
