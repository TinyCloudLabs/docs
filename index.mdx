    Building a browser-based app? Start with the [Web SDK Quickstart](/quickstart/web-sdk).

    You'll learn:
    - Connect user wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
    - Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE)
    - Store and retrieve user data
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Backend Developers">
    Building a server or CLI? Start with the [Node SDK Quickstart](/quickstart/node-sdk).

    You'll learn:
    - Authenticate with private keys
    - Manage namespaces programmatically
    - Create delegations for user access
  </Tab>

## Core Concepts

- **Namespaces**: Data ownership containers tied to user identity
- **KV Storage**: Key-value storage within namespaces
- **Delegations**: Shareable, scoped access permissions using UCAN
