# TinyCloud Documentation

TinyCloud is a decentralized, user-owned data storage platform built on [UCAN capabilities](https://ucan.xyz/) and [Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)](https://login.xyz/) authentication. It gives users full ownership of their data while enabling fine-grained, delegatable access control for applications and collaborators.

  <Tab title="Web Developers">
    Building a browser-based application? Start with the [Web SDK Quickstart](/quickstart/web-sdk).

    You'll learn how to:
    - Connect user wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
    - Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE)
    - Store and retrieve user data in spaces
    - Share data through delegations and sharing links
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Backend Developers">
    Building a server, API, or CLI tool? Start with the [Node SDK Quickstart](/quickstart/node-sdk).

    You'll learn how to:
    - Authenticate with private keys
    - Manage spaces programmatically
    - Create delegations for user access
    - Build server-side integrations with TinyCloud storage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Key Management (OpenKey)">
    Need simplified authentication for your users? Start with the [OpenKey overview](/openkey/index).

    You'll learn how to:
    - Embed the OpenKey widget for seamless sign-in
    - Integrate OpenKey with OAuth providers
    - Connect OpenKey with TinyCloud storage
  </Tab>

## Core Concepts

- **Spaces** - Data ownership containers tied to user identity. Each user gets a space where their application data lives. [Learn more](/guides/spaces)
- **KV Storage** - Key-value storage within spaces for reading and writing application data. [Learn more](/guides/kv-storage)
- **Delegations** - Shareable, scoped access permissions built on UCAN. Grant other users or applications specific capabilities over your data. [Learn more](/guides/delegations)
- **Sharing Links** - Generate links that grant temporary or scoped access to data without requiring the recipient to have an existing account. [Learn more](/guides/sharing)
